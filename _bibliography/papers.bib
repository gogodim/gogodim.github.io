  abstract={As the share of variable renewable energy sources increases in the electricity mix, new solutions are needed to build a flexible and reliable grid. Energy arbitrage with battery storage systems supports renewable energy integration into the grid by shifting demand and increasing the overall utilization of power production systems. In this paper, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model for energy arbitrage on the day-ahead market, that takes into account operational and availability constraints of asset owners willing to get an additional revenue stream from their storage asset. This approach optimally schedules the charge and discharge operations associated with the most profitable trading strategy, and achieves between 80% and 90% of the maximum obtainable profits considering one-year time horizons using the prices of electricity in multiple European countries including Germany, France, Italy, Denmark, and Spain.},
