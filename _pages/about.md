My name is Gorazd Dimitrov. I was born and raised in Skopje, Macedonia, where I also attended my early education. 
During my high school days I spent a significant time on preparing and participating in renowned international competitions and Olympiads mainly in mathematics (Intenrational Mathematics Olympiad - IMO), but also in computer science, physics and robotics. After graduating from High School at Yahya Kemal College Skopje, I decided to continue my studies abroad. 
Being admitted with honors, and recieving an excellence scholarship I decided to pursue a double degree in matematics and computer science at Ecole Polytechnique in France. After graduating magna cum laude in the bachelor program I continued my masters at Ecole Polytechnique by following a theoretical computer science program, the MPRI (Parisian Research Master in Computer Science). 
While following courses at the MPRI I decided to reorient myself from theoretical computer science to applied mathematics and Operations Research (OR). To strengthen my knowledge in Operations Research, after recieving a PSL excellence scholarship for graduate students in computer science, I followed a masters at University Paris Dauphine-PSL with focus on Mathematical Optimization and Decision Theory (Modeling, Optimization, Decision, Organization - MODO).
During my academic days I have completed a number of internships in both industry (Palantir, Orange, MyBrain Technologies...) and research labs (INRIA Saclay, LIX Polytechnique...), while also leading two student orgnaizations (IEEE Student Branch Polytechnique, Computer Science Committee).
