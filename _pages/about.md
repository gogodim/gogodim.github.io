My name is <b>Gorazd Dimitrov</b>. I was born and raised in <b>Skopje, Macedonia</b>, where I also attended my early education. 

During my high school days I spent a significant time on preparing and participating in renowned international <b>competitions and Olympiads</b> mainly in mathematics (Intenrational Mathematics Olympiad - IMO), but also in computer science, physics and robotics. After graduating from High School at Yahya Kemal College Skopje, I decided to continue my studies <b>abroad</b>. 

Being admitted with honors, and recieving an excellence scholarship I decided to pursue a <b>double degree</b> in matematics and computer science at <b>Ecole Polytechnique</b> in <b>France</b>. After graduating <b>magna cum laude</b> in the bachelor program I continued my masters at Ecole Polytechnique by following a <b>theoretical computer science</b> program, the <b>MPRI</b> (Parisian Research Master in Computer Science). 

While following courses at the MPRI I decided to reorient myself from theoretical computer science to <b>applied mathematics and Operations Research (OR)</b>. To strengthen my knowledge in Operations Research, after recieving a PSL excellence scholarship for graduate students in computer science, I followed a masters at University <b>Paris Dauphine-PSL</b> with focus on <b>Mathematical Optimization and Decision Theory</b> (Modeling, Optimization, Decision, Organization - MODO).

During my academic days I have completed a number of <b>internships</b> in both <b>industry</b> (<b>Palantir</b>, Orange, MyBrainTechnologies...) and <b>research</b> labs (<b>INRIA</b> Saclay, LIX Polytechnique...), while also leading two <b>student orgnaizations</b> (<b>IEEE</b> Student Branch Polytechnique, Computer Science Committee).
