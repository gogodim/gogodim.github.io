<b>Abstract:</b> In the scope of our C++ project I lead a team of 7 in creating a web application for sharing order delivery cost.

<b>Time:</b> 3 months (2020 and 2021)

<b>Technologies:</b> C++, QT, WT

<b>Contributions:</b><b>
<ul>
  <li>Ideation; I pitched the idea and solution, and after enough people were interested in it the idea was chosen as one of the few to be turned into a project.</li>
  <li>Initial project architecture design and team organization.</li>
  <li>Front-end especilly exploring and explaining to the team how the WT library for C++ is used.</li>
  <li>Database infrastructure.</li>
  <li>Directly worked on the time, cost and spatial multi-objective heuristic optimization algorithms.</li>
